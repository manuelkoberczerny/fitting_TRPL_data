# Fitting TRPL Data

### Type of Experimental Data
time-resolved photoluminescence data obtained from a [picoquant system](https://www.picoquant.com/products/category/fluorescence-spectrometers/fluotime-300-high-performance-fluorescence-lifetime-spectrometer)

# Installation
### Windows and MacOS (Python users)
Create and activate a new Python (version 3.10) virtual environment e.g. using [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html), [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) etc. Then clone this repository using [git](https://git-scm.com) and navigate to its newly created directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/manuelkoberczerny/fitting_TRPL_data.git
```

# Usage
